  <p align="justify">24th December 2018</p>

    <b>1. Introduction</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    The aim of this post is not to understand infinity - rather, it is to demonstrate
    the oddities and pure weirdness that arises from this concept. The Latin term
    <i>ad infinitum</i> translates to <i>to infinity</i>, which is commonly
    used in mathematics when describing sequences, summations, etc... that tend to
    infinity. We demonstrate the concept with a simple example, which almost everyone
    has probably encountered at some point during their formal education.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
   To say that a number sequence is recurring is to say that it repeats indefinitely -
   <i>ad infinitum</i>. So, what is zero point nine recurring - $0.\bar{9}$? At any
   given decimal place, the integer 9 is to be found. We can express this formally as a
   summation, $$0.\bar{9} = 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + ... = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} \dfrac{9}{10^i}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
   It can be challenging at first to see that this in-fact is simply the integer 1 in
   disguise. When one first encounters this statement, the first thought is typically
   how can this be, imagining that they can take the difference between 1 and <i>a very large <b>but</b> finite</i>
   number of decimal places with the integer 9. This - in a sense - is correct: One
   can take more decimal places then there are particles in the Universe, as long as
    the number of decimal places taken is finite, then the result would not be 1.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    However, truly, this notion is incorrect. There is the underlying assumption of
    the finite condition, when in fact we are saying that 9 must repeat indefinitely.
    This, on a side note, demonstrates the importance of logic in mathematics.
    Providing a proof that $0.\bar{9} = 1$ is a simple exercise in algebra:
    $$\begin{align*}
    x &= 0.\bar{9}\\
    10x &= 9.\bar{9} = 9 + 0.\bar{9} = 9 + x\\
    9x &= 9\\
    x &= 1 \hspace{5mm} \square
    \end{align*}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    The above proof makes a seemingly bewildering concept seem trivial, through
    the use of symbolic notation (a process of high level abstraction). So, does
    one now understand what happens <i>ad infinitum</i>? Foolish is one who thinks
    so - we are always at odds with the concept of <i>ad infinitum</i>!
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    <b>2. Not One-of-a-Kind</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    We call the set of positive integers, starting from 1, then 2, 3, etc... as
    the <i>set</i> of <i>natural numbers</i>. Abstractly, a set is a collection
    of objects without repetitions and in which ordering is not important. We refer
    to the size of a set as its <i>cardinality</i>. For any natural number that
    one can think of, the integer 1 can always be summed to it, defining a new and
    larger natural number. For this concept, in everyday language we typically say
    that <i>there is an infinite number of natural numbers</i>.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    More formally however, we say that there is a <i>countably</i>-infinite number
    of natural numbers. We thus say that the cardinality of the natural numbers
    is countably infinite. The reason being that, we can always start from 1
    and start counting our way up - granted, one will never stop counting - but
    nonetheless, one is still counting. Counting <i>ad infinitum</i>!
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Consider the odd and even numbers. If $n$ is a natural number, an odd number
    can be generated by writing $2n - 1$ and an even number can be generated by
    writing $2n$. These are informal examples of <i>functions</i>, mapping between
    the naturals and the odd/even numbers. We note that, the natural numbers in
    fact consist alternating odd and even numbers. Thus, at first, one may think
    that the cardinality of the set of odd numbers is half the cardinality of the
    set of natural numbers in its entirety. Similarly for the set of even numbers.
    However, it is easy to show that in fact the cardinality of the set of odds and
    the set of evens is <i>countably infinite</i> for both, the same as the
    cardinality of the set of naturals.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Consider for example the function that generates the odd numbers: for every
    unique natural number one inputs, a unique odd number is generated. There is
    a one-to-one correspondence between the odds and the naturals, counting the
    odds is equivalent to counting the naturals. The table below illustrates this process,
    $$\begin{array}{c|c}
		\text{Naturals} & \text{Generated Odds} \\ \hline \hline
		1 & 1\\
		2 & 3\\
		3 & 5\\
		\vdots & \vdots\\
		n & 2n - 1\\
		\vdots & \vdots
	\end{array}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    A similar correspondence exists for the even numbers, through the one-to-one
    association of the function that generates the evens with the natural numbers.
    The result is, to say the least, counter-intuitive. This is the first true
    example of the weirdness that can occur <i>ad infinitum</i>.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    We can think of a different kind of infinity - <i>uncountably infinite</i>.
    Take for example all the numbers between 0 and 1 - how many are there? Can one
    count them? The answer is no - not only is there an infinite number, but a
    countably infinite number. To demonstrate this, we shall use an ingenious
    argument known as <i>Cantor's Diagonal Argument</i>. Suppose that there is an
    association between the natural numbers and the numbers between 0 and 1, in a unique manner.
    In other words, suppose that there are countably infinite numbers between 0 and 1.
    We shall symbolically denote this association by $f$, short for <i>function</i>.
    For a given natural number $n$, $f(n)$ uniquely gives a number between 0 and 1.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Consider the decimal expansion of $f(n)$,
    $$f(n) = 0.a_{n_1} a_{n_2} a_{n_3} ... a_{n_k}...$$
    where the terms in $a$ are simply integers between 0 and 9.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Now consider :
    $$\begin{array}{ccccccc}
    f(1) = & 0. & \mathbf{a_{1_1}} & a_{1_2} & a_{1_3} & a_{1_4} & ... \\
    f(2) = & 0. & a_{2_1} & \mathbf{a_{2_2}} & a_{2_3} & a_{2_4} & ... \\
    f(3) = & 0. & a_{3_1} & a_{3_2} & \mathbf{a_{3_3}} & a_{3_4} & ... \\
    f(4) = & 0. & a_{4_1} & a_{4_2} & a_{4_3} & \mathbf{a_{4_4}} & ... \\
    \vdots & 0. & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    \end{array}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    We now construct a number $y$ between 0 and 1, such that $y = 0.y_{1}y_{2}y_{3}y_{4}...$ is defined as :
    $$y_{n} = \begin{cases}
    1,& \text{if } a_{n_n} = 0\\
    0,& \text{if } a_{n_n} \neq 0
    \end{cases}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    By construction, $y$ differs with respect to $f(1)$ in the first position,
    differs with respect to $f(2)$ in the second position, differs with respect
    to $f(n)$ in the $n$th position, etc...
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Thus for any natural number $n$, $f(n)$ is not $y$ and thus $y$ is never counted
    by $f$. This is a contradiction - thus an association $f$ which counts the
    numbers between 0 and 1 cannot exist. Therefore, the cardinality of the set
    of number between 0 and 1 is <i>uncountably infinite</i>.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    <b>3. Tiling a Square with Squares</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Suppose that one is given a square of arbitrary side length $a$. We begin tiling
    this square iteratively in the following manner: During the first iteration,
    at each corner, place a square of length $\dfrac{a}{4}$. For the second iteration,
    5 squares of length $\dfrac{a}{8}$ are tiled around each corner, i.e. a total of
    20 smaller squares, and so on... this is illustrated in the diagram below.
    <b>Is it possible to cover the square entirely in such a manner?</b>
  </p>

  <img src="images/tiling.png" width="400" height="400">

  <p align="justify">
    The interested may try to show that the area $A_n$ covered by these tiles at the
    $n$th iteration is given by,
    $$A_n = a^2 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dfrac{2^{i+3}-12}{4^{i+1}}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    The expression above is simply included for completeness sake - anyone with
    access to Wolfram's Mathematica software is encouraged to play around a bit with
    this expression and evaluate it for different values of $n$. The table below gives
    some sample outputs,
    $$\begin{array}{c|l}
		n & A_n \\ \hline \hline
		1 & 0.25a^2\\
		2 & 0.5625a^2\\
		10 & 0.998048a^2
	\end{array}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    It becomes immediately apparent that even for small values of $n$, the tiling
    practically covers the entire area of the square. However, for any finite number
    of iterations $n$, $A_n < a^2$ still. One can imagine that an incredibly thin cross
    remains untiled about the centre of the square. Yet, if one carries on tiling
    indefinitely, as $n\to\infty$, $A_n = a^2$.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    This is yet another seemingly counter-intuitive result: it is only if one tiles indefinitely
    that one can cover the entire surface area of the square, otherwise some area (even
    if infinitesimally small) remains untiled.

<div class="content">
  <p align="justify">
    <b>1. Ambiguity in Natural Languages</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    When one looks at the development of natural languages, it becomes immediately apparent that
    their development has taken an unstructured path, changing and developing with the times.
    As a consequence, situations of ambiguity may arise. Such ambiguity may, for
    example, contribute to the beauty of a piece of prose or poetry. However in
    Mathematics, this can lead to confusion and inharmonious theories. A simple
    example of ambiguity that may arise in day-to-day speech is the following:
    "This old dog still has what it takes to learn new tricks!"
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Someone more inclined towards the use of idioms in the English language, may
    interpret the previous as referring to someone of old age, still with the capacity
    to learn something new. Someone more inclined towards literal meaning however
    may interpret the previous as referring to an old dog, learning new dog tricks.
    No more, no less.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Logic provides a useful set of tools to aid in checking and resolving many instances
    of ambiguity, while also looking at compound statements without a broader scope.
    In other words, context is only dependent on what is already known, and free
    of any externalities. It is for these reasons then that logic serves as an integral
    part to the language of Mathematics. This use case is not exclusive to Mathematics
    however: Logic in all its forms is nowadays used heavily in Computer Science,
    and has been fundamental to the development of Philosophy since the times of Aristotle.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    <b>2. Propositions and Statements: Introduction to Symbolic Representations</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Logic often involves the simplification of worded statements and arguments
    into symbolic form. In order to understand this concept better, one must first
    define the <i>elementary proposition</i>. Such a proposition defines a singular
    fact, and its structure can be broken down into three components:
  </p>

</div>

<div class="content_left">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Nominator</b>: a unique object, eg. <i>violoncello</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Predicator</b>: a quality about said Nominator, eg. <i>in tune</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Copula</b>: joins the nominator and predicator, eg. <i>is</i>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="content">

  <p align="justify">
    Thus an example elementary proposition would be: <i>The violoncello is in tune</i>.
    Note that the Copula can be affirmative or negative. The previous example makes
    use of a Copula in the affirmative sense. However, <i>the violoncello is not in tune</i>,
    makes use of the Copula <i>is not</i>, which is in the negative sense. The collection
    of elementary propositions together brings about the formulation of a <i>complex proposition</i>.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    In a statement, elementary propositions are considered as <i>variables</i>. We
    denote variables symbolically by using letters. Example, <i>the violoncello is in tune</i>
    can be denoted in a statement by the letter $a$. However, it can can also be
    represented by any other letter, just as long as each elementary proposition
    in a statement has it’s own <i>unique</i> letter assigned to it, and not multiple,
    different, elementary propositions assigned the same letter. Before one translates
    a statement into symbolic form, it is important that one lists what each of the
    variables used means.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    For example, <i>either the sky is falling or I am out of my mind</i>, consists
    of two elementary propositions. Let $a$ be <i>the sky is falling</i> and let $b$
    be <i>I am out of my mind</i>. Symbolically, we have: either $a$ or $b$.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Notice then that, this provides a means of representing the logic behind a
    statement, independent from the actual context in which is resides. If one is simply
    told that either $a$ or $b$, one does not know if $a$ is talking about how
    Dmitry has eccentric tendencies, or how Martha has a glistening smile. Similarly
    for $b$.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    In the next installment, an overview of <i>logical operators</i> shall be given,
    completing our study of symbolic representations. Logical operators provide
    are what link elemntary propositions, and are the crux to solving ambiguity
    using a logical system. So for example, <i>either...or...</i> corresponds to
    some particular logical operator, to be discussed in another article.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    <b>3. A Brief Introduction To Truth Tables</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    A variable (with reference to an elementary proposition) may be in one of either two
    states: <b>True</b>, or <b>False</b>. As discussed, a statement typically has
    multiple elementary propositions, and thus one ends up with multiple variables.
    Since each variable has $2$ possible states, if a statement consists of $n$ variables,
    then the number of state-combinations possible between these variables if $2^n$, i.e.
    $2$ multiplied with itself for $n$ times. A simple combinatorial result!
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Since elementary propositions in a statement are related (or better, <i>operated on</i>)
    by logical operators, the output of these operators, for a particular combination of states,
    give a True or False value to the entire statement. In other words, one would be able to deduce
    if a statement is in fact True or False, independent of external context. This last point is
    important - some statements deemed True by logic, may be utter nonsense in the 'real' world.
    In this manner, this 'real' world is no more than uneccassary context.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Truth tables provide a simple means of listing all possible combinations, and
    the resulting corresponding state of the statement. For some statment represented
    using two variables, the number of combinations is four. These are listed below,
    along with an example worked out statement in the rightmost column.
    $$\begin{array}{cc||c}
		\mathbf{a} & \mathbf{b} & \mathbf{a} \ \text{and} \ \mathbf{b}\\ \hline \hline
		\text{True} & \text{True} & \text{True} \\
    \text{True} & \text{False} & \text{False} \\
    \text{False} & \text{False} & \text{False}\\
    \text{False} & \text{False} & \text{False}
	\end{array}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
  The truth table above describes how a logical operator representing the keyword
  <i>and</i> in natural languages, operates between two variables to give an output.
  Look at the truth table, along taking note of the values of the variables and the
  corresponding output. Notice how the statement is true only when the all variables
  are true.

  <h1><b>Stanley Fiorini: Mathematician & Historian</b></h1>
  <p align="justify">8th April 2020</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
  <p align="justify">
  Professor <b>Stanley Fiorini </b>is often regarded as the father of graph theory in Malta
  and is a well-respected historian. The <i>Second Malta Conference in Graph
  Theory and Combinatorics</i>, of 2016, was held in celebration of his 75th
  birthday and his career as a mathematician. <b>Xandru Mifsud </b>sat down with
  Professor Fiorini for a two-part interview, to discuss his early encounters
  with mathematics, introducing graph theory in Malta, and his work as a
  historian. The author would like to express his gratitude towards Stanley for
  his thoughtful answers! </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>X:
  </b>Firstly, perhaps
  you would like to introduce yourself to our readers? </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>S:
  </b>Well, I'm Stanley
  Fiorini, 78 years old next birthday, in November. I've lived a happy life and
  I've always done things that I enjoy doing. I've never done something unless my
  heart wasn't in it fully, so I tended to move from one area to another, depending on the
  circumstances. I don't know what else, ask me! </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>X:
  </b>If I had to meet a young Stanley in class, would I have been immediately able to say that he's going
  to be a mathematician, or maybe even a historian? </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>S:
  </b>Well, I've always had an orderly life, and that's very conducive to logical thinking. All my
  copybooks at school were very neat. I was very proud of presenting very neat work, underlining answers in
  red and that kind of thing. </p>

  <p align="justify">I
  also loved problem-solving from very early on, doing puzzles, which I still
  enjoy doing, and also on reflection before this interview, creating puzzles.
  That was kind of an embryonic element of the tendency to do research, which is
  creative work. So if you were very perceptive, then you might put all this
  together and say, yes, he could be a mathematician. </p>

  <p align="justify">I
  also loved music. I was born in a very musical environment, with my
  elder sister’s piano
  always in the background. My father, too, was always playing his gramophone
  records. These two things I think do go together, mathematics and music. The
  music I love best is Johann Sebastian Bach, who is very orderly and mathematical.
  I got to love
  him with a passion, especially when later on I took up playing the violin. </p>

  <p align="justify">So
  perhaps yes, from early on the indications were there. I also did well at
  school, since I always had the benefit of very good teachers in mathematics,
  both in primary and in secondary school. I only failed once, and I do attribute
  that to bad teaching! But I will not repeat in what year or in what
  circumstances. </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>The Mathematician </b></p>

  <p align="justify"><b>X:
  </b>You mentioned that
  you had teachers that promoted mathematics. Do you consider that maybe during
  your education there was that one particular teacher that gave you an extra
  push or maybe there was that one formative moment? </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>S:
  </b>Well, in Form 5 Mr. Frisk used to
  inspire me with his originality in dealing with mathematical problems.
  Afterwards, for my A-Levels, I was taken under the wing of Edwin Borg Costanzi,
  who had recently returned
  from Oxford. It started with going to his evening classes in Valletta, in the
  Evans Labs, there was in that class Joe Formosa who was a technician in the University
  physics lab in those
  days. Then afterwards I used to go to private tuition under Edwin, who kept on urging me to go to Oxford where
  he himself had studied. This I did at great sacrifice because
  financially I wasn't prepared for it. </p>

  <p align="justify">Edwin also introduced me to his former
  tutor, Jack De Wet, from South Africa. For my first
  year, Jack was my tutor at Balliol. In Oxford I had excellent tuition; foremost in my mind is Keith
  Hannabuss, also of Balliol, to
  whom I subsequently arranged for Joseph Muscat to
  go and work with; Joseph
  did extremely
  well at Oxford.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">Perhaps
  I should say something about Oxford, and how the system worked. Oxford is an excellent
  university, with a
  beautiful mathematical institute, in the sense that there
  you came across all the ‘beautiful minds’ you wanted to meet. In combinatorics, Dominic Welsh is
  foremost. Among
  students in my year, there were
  Peter Cameron and Paul Seymour, both of them bright luminaries in the
  combinatorial world, even now in the States, where
  they settled. </p>

  <p align="justify">The
  terms were short - eight weeks of term, six weeks of vac, which was no vacation
  at all, as in those six weeks you had to absorb what had gone right over your
  head during the preceding eight weeks. So we hardly had any
  holidays during the year. Then we had very long summer holidays, during which I
  used to come down to
  Malta, and work and work. But as I said, financially it was very difficult. The
  only accommodation I could afford was a tiny cubicle, perhaps eight feet by
  four, in which
  the bed had to be folded up during the day
  to make room for a tiny makeshift desk.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">The space was so restricted that you froze if you did
  not put on your heater, and if you did
  put your heater on,
  then you were
  scorched! So I spent my days in the Radcliffe Science Library, from morning
  till night, except for meals. We had one exam, called moderations, at the end of
  the first year, with three
  papers on algebra, analysis and methods. Then the final examination after three
  years, in which you faced
  27 hours of examination in five days. Three hours in the morning, three hours
  in the evening, Monday to Friday lunchtime. No kids’
  gloves treatment; nothing
  like what Maltese students are regaled with
  today and no one ever questioned the system.
  This meant that
  you had to be prepared to your teeth, and have all the stuff at
  your fingertips; no exam-free couple of days before each test to allow for
  last- hour cramming and then forgetting all about it. </p>

  <p align="justify">You
  had the first six papers of standard stuff: algebra, analysis, etc, and then
  you had three papers on what we could call electives, a choice of
  a couple of topics from a wide variety of options available. I opted for functional analysis and combinatorics; this is where I came across a certain Robin
  Wilson, who tutored me and introduced
  me to graph theory. And that was my initiation into the subject. I immediately
  took to it because it's very attractive, in the sense that you have very
  difficult problems which are immediately accessible, to mention, for example,
  the Four Colour Problem. Robin
  stimulated me highly
  exposing
  me to such problems
  like the Zarankiewicz Problem, the Reconstruction Problem, and, of course, colourings in general and edge-colourings in particular. </p>

  <p align="justify">When
  I returned to Malta and started teaching at Junior College, I had kept mulling
  over these new
  concepts, working at
  them, and also trying my hand at creating solutions, rather than regurgitating
  other people’s stuff.
  I also started using the computer to obtain certain solutions; at the time handling
  computers
  was very different from what we are used to these days. The machine in the
  computer lab at Oxford occupied a whole house. To write a programme you had to write a
  card for every single
  statement in it, ending
  up with a pack of cards
  several centimetres high; this
  you then fed
  into this machine, out of which
  came your
  solution. I'm very thankful
  to Carmel Galea (of Megabyte), who was more adept at computing than
  I was, for helping me out with my
  programming at the
  time. We were then both
  teaching at Junior College. There was also Irene Sciriha teaching there, she
  was doing applied mathematics. I enjoyed that year - I still remember students,
  some of whom
  still come up to me and remind me of those happy days when I introduced them to
  a different way of teaching- what I had learnt at Oxford, of course. </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>X:
  </b>How then did your
  PhD come about? </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>S:
  </b>It was<b> </b>Edwin
  again who came
  to my rescue, bringing to my notice a conference that was to take place at St. Andrews University, Scotland,
  and offering me financial
  support to attend – how
  lovely! By that time I
  had met Joan, my future wife, whom I informed
  that I was going to St. Andrews for the ten-day conference. This was a workshop with three
  areas of instruction,
  one of which
  was given by
  Frank Harary, who had striven hard to promote graph theory. Another was on optimisation,
  given by Vargas, and
  the third
  on algebra, given by Cohn.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">That
  was very enjoyable, both contentwise and for the
  opportunity it provided to
  renew old friendships. For example, at
  this conference among others there
  was Hilton from Reading. At the time I was working on a graph theory problem to which I was trying to
  apply some complex analytic methods. In Oxford, at the time there was Dr.
  Hilary Priestly of
  St. Margaret's, who had lectured me on the subject, and I thought
  that before going down
  to London’s Heathrow, I
  could pop in at Oxford
  and have a chat with
  her about this. I went to Oxford and I couldn't find her as
  it was summer vac,
  but I did meet Robin Wilson again,
  whose very first words were,
  'Ah! You're the one I want to talk to'. </p>

  <p align="justify">In the
  meantime, he had moved
  from Oxford to the Open University where, at the time, he was rooting around for his
  first potential
  PhD students. It so happened that his first candidate, for some reason,
  had been unable to accept the offer, and Robin was now looking for a
  replacement. He told
  me that he had the
  money for a PhD studentship, asking me if I'd be willing to
  accept and to
  start in
  October. That was in August, my future
  wife didn't like it at all, but agreed for me to go back in October. I started working on
  edge-colourings, which is what Robin
  wanted to do. He had just produced a little paper with Beineke, which
  became my spring-board.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">Thank God,
  my former financial headache was now over, because
  now I had the
  scholarship. At this stage I must show my gratitude to my family that
  supported me as best they could
  throughout my difficult undergraduate
  days. I had then approached
  the financial aspect of my study very näively. I knew that at the
  time tuition was once a week, and it cost two quid for an hour's tuition. So I
  said to my self, “Fine: eight weeks of term, eight
  tutorials at 2 quid, eight times two is sixteen, I need some money for food, and
  some money for
  accommodation.”
  I think that in
  the end I was packed off with about 500 quid at the time, and that was just not
  on. Another
  500 I had to borrow
  from a kind person, and my
  family supplemented
  as best they could, for which
  I am
  eternally grateful. </p>

  <p align="justify">So
  I went back to the Open University and started working. The intention was that Joan
  and I would get
  married within a year’s time, in January next. I came down to Malta in Christmas
  when we
  got officially engaged,
  waiting for another year to
  get married. </p>

  <p align="justify">I
  must mention something you'd appreciate. I was living in digs at the moment, and I was
  having my meals at Greyfriars College – the college of my undergraduate
  days, which no longer
  exists. Coming back to my digs one evening, I suddenly
  spotted a logical flaw
  in a fundamental statement I had made, and on which I had built a couple of
  months’
  work. I had a terrible experience of a nervous attack - my tongue became heavy, my hands were heavy. I just
  had to lie down on my bed and weather it out. An
  experience like this
  at the beginning of your research career could be very disheartening, but somehow, although I couldn't amend the
  flaw, there were other areas I could attend to and in the end it worked out well.
  In fact within two years I had completed my thesis “On
  the Chromatic Index of Simple Graphs”. During my third and final year I was kind of doing a postdoc
  and also helping Wilson with teaching at Balliol, a part-time
  post which he
  had retained, and that
  brought me into contact with some very good graph theory students from the
  college. It was a time to start accumulating a of problems and topics
  of interest. </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>X:
  </b>I have heard on
  multiple occasions that you are considered as the father of Graph Theory in
  Malta. What was it like introducing this new area at the university? </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>S:
  </b>I came back to
  Malta in 1975,
  by which time we had had our
  baby girl, Christina -
  luckily she came after I had completed
  my thesis, as otherwise
  it would have been impossible working with
  all the din that babies produce in their first months - I had a stock of problems to work
  on, and also to introduce to students in Malta. </p>

  <p align="justify">You
  bombastically said that I'm the father of Graph Theory in Malta - well, let's
  not exaggerate too much. Graph Theory had not been taught here before and so it did
  begin
  with me, and that’s all that needs to be said. At the time there was Josef
  Lauri, who was doing a Masters, when our department had introduced the subject at
  Masters level. The number of staff members of the Maths Department was very small in
  those years. There
  were many foreign lecturers at RUM
  then - Edward Borg
  Costanzi was still firmly seated in the Rector’s chair, and he preferred to work
  with foreigners. As for Maltese in Maths, there was me, Joe Pulè, and Albert Leone Ganado. Albert
  eventually moved to computing. That was all in 1975. Again, Edwin had
  an excellent idea on how academics
  could carry on with their research,
  despite our rather heavy
  teaching load. In 1976, he gave me a chance to go back to Oxford for six
  months, which he paid for, allowing me to
  concentrate on my
  research from Easter till October, provided I crammed all my teaching
  duties in the first
  couple of semesters.
  But during
  those six months, I could worked
  solidlywithout distractions. That's where I got my ideas on
  working with reconstruction [1, 2, 3]. I produced about four papers within
  those six months. Some of them jointly, one with Manvel, and I also typed out
  my thesis, which I published with Wilson - <i>Edge Colourings of Graphs</i>
  [4]. </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>X:
  </b>It almost feels
  like all of this was accidental... </p>

  <p align="justify"><b>S:
  </b>Yes, I
  would call it force of
  circumstance. I always led myself by the principle – accept life as it comes, always take what you have, make the
  best of that, and something good will come out of it. Don't waste time - time
  management is most important for me. So as soon as we finish this interview, I'll
  be going
  back to my history, interspersed with some shopping which the wife has to do! </p>

  <p align="justify">As
  I was saying, in those six months, I produced the gist of nine papers, and
  typed out my book. Then in 1977, dark clouds started looming on the horizon for
  the university, because there were problems with the doctors. I had to get
  involved with union work, from the university point of view, as I was secretary
  of the union for university staff, and when things got rough we dissolved our house union
  and joined the Malta Union of Teachers, as we needed strength in numbers.
  And things started becoming impossible to concentrate
  and do
  any research in that
  ruckus. Funds for the library dwindled, you couldn't find books, there was no
  way to go to conferences. The university was shrinking, many people were
  leaving, many good people, including and especially the doctors started
  leaving. By 1979 I couldn't take it anymore. Joe Pulè had gone to Ireland, where he
  still is, and again Edwin gave me the advice not to burn my boat as
  yet. I was going to
  sell my house, as I had a buyer, a good buyer. I still had contacts with the
  Open University, so I arranged for someone there to come to Malta, on an exchange
  basis. He, for his own
  personal reasons, needed to be away from there and so he came here to teach,
  and I went there to replace him. </p>

  <p align="justify">His
  job was that of
  ‘staff tutor’ at the Bristol office, which means
  that he was organising the teaching of mathematics in the whole of the
  southwest of England, from Cheltenham in the north to the Scilly Isles in the
  south. I went to Bristol, and I had to travel to these various places where
  tuition was going on, and organise the teaching of mathematics. So,
  administratively it was a very rewarding job. Also, I had started tutoring
  Lauri for his PhD on graph reconstruction,
  and I said,
  “Why don't you
  come over to the Open University and finish your PhD here?”. I arranged for his financial
  support, he came over,
  and for some time he lived with us until he got his own accommodation. It was working beautifully
  as we were coming up with important results, which you can see in publications
  [5, 6, 7];
  and he finished his PhD there. That was for two years - he had already
  done one year in
  Malta before, then did two other
  years at
  the O.U., finishing in good time. Then I came back to Malta in
  1982. Why did I come back to Malta? I could have stayed there, the Open
  University had offered
  me a very good job, so I could have taken that. But, I realised while in
  England - well, I must say that I liked England, it's my second home, I had
  spent 12 years there, so from that point of view I was happy - but I realised
  that I was exiling myself from something very dear to me: my attachment to my roots. And I suddenly wanted
  badly to rationalise this irrational attachment. So I said, I'll go back come what may. And it was
  really come what may, for
  soon again I was out on strike under orders of the union for the Imnarja
  occasion. </p>
