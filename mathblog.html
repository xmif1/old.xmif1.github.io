    <b>1. Introduction</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    The aim of this post is not to understand infinity - rather, it is to demonstrate
    the oddities and pure weirdness that arises from this concept. The Latin term
    <i>ad infinitum</i> translates to <i>to infinity</i>, which is commonly
    used in mathematics when describing sequences, summations, etc... that tend to
    infinity. We demonstrate the concept with a simple example, which almost everyone
    has probably encountered at some point during their formal education.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
   To say that a number sequence is recurring is to say that it repeats indefinitely -
   <i>ad infinitum</i>. So, what is zero point nine recurring - $0.\bar{9}$? At any
   given decimal place, the integer 9 is to be found. We can express this formally as a
   summation, $$0.\bar{9} = 0.9 + 0.09 + 0.009 + ... = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{\infty} \dfrac{9}{10^i}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
   It can be challenging at first to see that this in-fact is simply the integer 1 in
   disguise. When one first encounters this statement, the first thought is typically
   how can this be, imagining that they can take the difference between 1 and <i>a very large <b>but</b> finite</i>
   number of decimal places with the integer 9. This - in a sense - is correct: One
   can take more decimal places then there are particles in the Universe, as long as
    the number of decimal places taken is finite, then the result would not be 1.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    However, truly, this notion is incorrect. There is the underlying assumption of
    the finite condition, when in fact we are saying that 9 must repeat indefinitely.
    This, on a side note, demonstrates the importance of logic in mathematics.
    Providing a proof that $0.\bar{9} = 1$ is a simple exercise in algebra:
    $$\begin{align*}
    x &= 0.\bar{9}\\
    10x &= 9.\bar{9} = 9 + 0.\bar{9} = 9 + x\\
    9x &= 9\\
    x &= 1 \hspace{5mm} \square
    \end{align*}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    The above proof makes a seemingly bewildering concept seem trivial, through
    the use of symbolic notation (a process of high level abstraction). So, does
    one now understand what happens <i>ad infinitum</i>? Foolish is one who thinks
    so - we are always at odds with the concept of <i>ad infinitum</i>!
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>2. Not One-of-a-Kind</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    We call the set of positive integers, starting from 1, then 2, 3, etc... as
    the <i>set</i> of <i>natural numbers</i>. Abstractly, a set is a collection
    of objects without repetitions and in which ordering is not important. We refer
    to the size of a set as its <i>cardinality</i>. For any natural number that
    one can think of, the integer 1 can always be summed to it, defining a new and
    larger natural number. For this concept, in everyday language we typically say
    that <i>there is an infinite number of natural numbers</i>.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    More formally however, we say that there is a <i>countably</i>-infinite number
    of natural numbers. We thus say that the cardinality of the natural numbers
    is countably infinite. The reason being that, we can always start from 1
    and start counting our way up - granted, one will never stop counting - but
    nonetheless, one is still counting. Counting <i>ad infinitum</i>!
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Consider the odd and even numbers. If $n$ is a natural number, an odd number
    can be generated by writing $2n - 1$ and an even number can be generated by
    writing $2n$. These are informal examples of <i>functions</i>, mapping between
    the naturals and the odd/even numbers. We note that, the natural numbers in
    fact consist alternating odd and even numbers. Thus, at first, one may think
    that the cardinality of the set of odd numbers is half the cardinality of the
    set of natural numbers in its entirety. Similarly for the set of even numbers.
    However, it is easy to show that in fact the cardinality of the set of odds and
    the set of evens is <i>countably infinite</i> for both, the same as the
    cardinality of the set of naturals.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Consider for example the function that generates the odd numbers: for every
    unique natural number one inputs, a unique odd number is generated. There is
    a one-to-one correspondence between the odds and the naturals, counting the
    odds is equivalent to counting the naturals. The table below illustrates this process,
    $$\begin{array}{c|c}
		\text{Naturals} & \text{Generated Odds} \\ \hline \hline
		1 & 1\\
		2 & 3\\
		3 & 5\\
		\vdots & \vdots\\
		n & 2n - 1\\
		\vdots & \vdots
	\end{array}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    A similar correspondence exists for the even numbers, through the one-to-one
    association of the function that generates the evens with the natural numbers.
    The result is, to say the least, counter-intuitive. This is the first true
    example of the weirdness that can occur <i>ad infinitum</i>.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    We can think of a different kind of infinity - <i>uncountably infinite</i>.
    Take for example all the numbers between 0 and 1 - how many are there? Can one
    count them? The answer is no - not only is there an infinite number, but a
    countably infinite number. To demonstrate this, we shall use an ingenious
    argument known as <i>Cantor's Diagonal Argument</i>. Suppose that there is an
    association between the natural numbers and the numbers between 0 and 1, in a unique manner.
    In other words, suppose that there are countably infinite numbers between 0 and 1.
    We shall symbolically denote this association by $f$, short for <i>function</i>.
    For a given natural number $n$, $f(n)$ uniquely gives a number between 0 and 1.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Consider the decimal expansion of $f(n)$,
    $$f(n) = 0.a_{n_1} a_{n_2} a_{n_3} ... a_{n_k}...$$
    where the terms in $a$ are simply integers between 0 and 9.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Now consider :
    $$\begin{array}{ccccccc}
    f(1) = & 0. & \mathbf{a_{1_1}} & a_{1_2} & a_{1_3} & a_{1_4} & ... \\
    f(2) = & 0. & a_{2_1} & \mathbf{a_{2_2}} & a_{2_3} & a_{2_4} & ... \\
    f(3) = & 0. & a_{3_1} & a_{3_2} & \mathbf{a_{3_3}} & a_{3_4} & ... \\
    f(4) = & 0. & a_{4_1} & a_{4_2} & a_{4_3} & \mathbf{a_{4_4}} & ... \\
    \vdots & 0. & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    \end{array}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    We now construct a number $y$ between 0 and 1, such that $y = 0.y_{1}y_{2}y_{3}y_{4}...$ is defined as :
    $$y_{n} = \begin{cases}
    1,& \text{if } a_{n_n} = 0\\
    0,& \text{if } a_{n_n} \neq 0
    \end{cases}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    By construction, $y$ differs with respect to $f(1)$ in the first position,
    differs with respect to $f(2)$ in the second position, differs with respect
    to $f(n)$ in the $n$th position, etc...
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Thus for any natural number $n$, $f(n)$ is not $y$ and thus $y$ is never counted
    by $f$. This is a contradiction - thus an association $f$ which counts the
    numbers between 0 and 1 cannot exist. Therefore, the cardinality of the set
    of number between 0 and 1 is <i>uncountably infinite</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>3. Tiling a Square with Squares</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Suppose that one is given a square of arbitrary side length $a$. We begin tiling
    this square iteratively in the following manner: During the first iteration,
    at each corner, place a square of length $\dfrac{a}{4}$. For the second iteration,
    5 squares of length $\dfrac{a}{8}$ are tiled around each corner, i.e. a total of
    20 smaller squares, and so on... this is illustrated in the diagram below.
    <b>Is it possible to cover the square entirely in such a manner?</b>
  </p>

  <img src="images/tiling.png" width="400" height="400">

  <p align="justify">
    The interested may try to show that the area $A_n$ covered by these tiles at the
    $n$th iteration is given by,
    $$A_n = a^2 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \dfrac{2^{i+3}-12}{4^{i+1}}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    The expression above is simply included for completeness sake - anyone with
    access to Wolfram's Mathematica software is encouraged to play around a bit with
    this expression and evaluate it for different values of $n$. The table below gives
    some sample outputs,
    $$\begin{array}{c|l}
		n & A_n \\ \hline \hline
		1 & 0.25a^2\\
		2 & 0.5625a^2\\
		10 & 0.998048a^2
	\end{array}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    It becomes immediately apparent that even for small values of $n$, the tiling
    practically covers the entire area of the square. However, for any finite number
    of iterations $n$, $A_n < a^2$ still. One can imagine that an incredibly thin cross
    remains untiled about the centre of the square. Yet, if one carries on tiling
    indefinitely, as $n\to\infty$, $A_n = a^2$.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    This is yet another seemingly counter-intuitive result: it is only if one tiles indefinitely
    that one can cover the entire surface area of the square, otherwise some area (even
    if infinitesimally small) remains untiled.

    <b>1. Ambiguity in Natural Languages</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    When one looks at the development of natural languages, it becomes immediately apparent that
    their development has taken an unstructured path, changing and developing with the times.
    As a consequence, situations of ambiguity may arise. Such ambiguity may, for
    example, contribute to the beauty of a piece of prose or poetry. However in
    Mathematics, this can lead to confusion and inharmonious theories. A simple
    example of ambiguity that may arise in day-to-day speech is the following:
    "This old dog still has what it takes to learn new tricks!"
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Someone more inclined towards the use of idioms in the English language, may
    interpret the previous as referring to someone of old age, still with the capacity
    to learn something new. Someone more inclined towards literal meaning however
    may interpret the previous as referring to an old dog, learning new dog tricks.
    No more, no less.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Logic provides a useful set of tools to aid in checking and resolving many instances
    of ambiguity, while also looking at compound statements without a broader scope.
    In other words, context is only dependent on what is already known, and free
    of any externalities. It is for these reasons then that logic serves as an integral
    part to the language of Mathematics. This use case is not exclusive to Mathematics
    however: Logic in all its forms is nowadays used heavily in Computer Science,
    and has been fundamental to the development of Philosophy since the times of Aristotle.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>2. Propositions and Statements: Introduction to Symbolic Representations</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Logic often involves the simplification of worded statements and arguments
    into symbolic form. In order to understand this concept better, one must first
    define the <i>elementary proposition</i>. Such a proposition defines a singular
    fact, and its structure can be broken down into three components:
  </p>

</div>

<div class="content_left">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Nominator</b>: a unique object, eg. <i>violoncello</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Predicator</b>: a quality about said Nominator, eg. <i>in tune</i>.</li>
    <li><b>Copula</b>: joins the nominator and predicator, eg. <i>is</i>.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="content">

  <p align="justify">
    Thus an example elementary proposition would be: <i>The violoncello is in tune</i>.
    Note that the Copula can be affirmative or negative. The previous example makes
    use of a Copula in the affirmative sense. However, <i>the violoncello is not in tune</i>,
    makes use of the Copula <i>is not</i>, which is in the negative sense. The collection
    of elementary propositions together brings about the formulation of a <i>complex proposition</i>.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    In a statement, elementary propositions are considered as <i>variables</i>. We
    denote variables symbolically by using letters. Example, <i>the violoncello is in tune</i>
    can be denoted in a statement by the letter $a$. However, it can can also be
    represented by any other letter, just as long as each elementary proposition
    in a statement has it’s own <i>unique</i> letter assigned to it, and not multiple,
    different, elementary propositions assigned the same letter. Before one translates
    a statement into symbolic form, it is important that one lists what each of the
    variables used means.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    For example, <i>either the sky is falling or I am out of my mind</i>, consists
    of two elementary propositions. Let $a$ be <i>the sky is falling</i> and let $b$
    be <i>I am out of my mind</i>. Symbolically, we have: either $a$ or $b$.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Notice then that, this provides a means of representing the logic behind a
    statement, independent from the actual context in which is resides. If one is simply
    told that either $a$ or $b$, one does not know if $a$ is talking about how
    Dmitry has eccentric tendencies, or how Martha has a glistening smile. Similarly
    for $b$.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    In the next installment, an overview of <i>logical operators</i> shall be given,
    completing our study of symbolic representations. Logical operators provide
    are what link elemntary propositions, and are the crux to solving ambiguity
    using a logical system. So for example, <i>either...or...</i> corresponds to
    some particular logical operator, to be discussed in another article.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>3. A Brief Introduction To Truth Tables</b>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    A variable (with reference to an elementary proposition) may be in one of either two
    states: <b>True</b>, or <b>False</b>. As discussed, a statement typically has
    multiple elementary propositions, and thus one ends up with multiple variables.
    Since each variable has $2$ possible states, if a statement consists of $n$ variables,
    then the number of state-combinations possible between these variables if $2^n$, i.e.
    $2$ multiplied with itself for $n$ times. A simple combinatorial result!
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Since elementary propositions in a statement are related (or better, <i>operated on</i>)
    by logical operators, the output of these operators, for a particular combination of states,
    give a True or False value to the entire statement. In other words, one would be able to deduce
    if a statement is in fact True or False, independent of external context. This last point is
    important - some statements deemed True by logic, may be utter nonsense in the 'real' world.
    In this manner, this 'real' world is no more than uneccassary context.
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
    Truth tables provide a simple means of listing all possible combinations, and
    the resulting corresponding state of the statement. For some statment represented
    using two variables, the number of combinations is four. These are listed below,
    along with an example worked out statement in the rightmost column.
    $$\begin{array}{cc||c}
		\mathbf{a} & \mathbf{b} & \mathbf{a} \ \text{and} \ \mathbf{b}\\ \hline \hline
		\text{True} & \text{True} & \text{True} \\
    \text{True} & \text{False} & \text{False} \\
    \text{False} & \text{False} & \text{False}\\
    \text{False} & \text{False} & \text{False}
	\end{array}$$
  </p>

  <p align="justify">
  The truth table above describes how a logical operator representing the keyword
  <i>and</i> in natural languages, operates between two variables to give an output.
  Look at the truth table, along taking note of the values of the variables and the
  corresponding output. Notice how the statement is true only when the all variables
  are true.
